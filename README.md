# Oscars 2024 SQL Case Study

Welcome to the Oscars 2024 SQL Case Study! This project focuses on extracting insights from the Oscars 2024 dataset using SQL queries. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find in this repository:

## Introduction
The Oscars 2024 SQL Case Study aims to showcase the power of SQL in analyzing and deriving insights from a dataset related to the Oscars awards ceremony held in 2024. The dataset includes information about winners, nominees, movies, and producers involved in the Oscars 2024.

## Database Schema
The database schema consists of three tables:
- Winners: Contains information about the winners of different categories at the Oscars 2024.
- Movies: Includes details about the movies released in 2023, such as title, producer, and release year.
- Nominees: Contains information about the nominees for various categories at the Oscars 2024.

## Queries
Several SQL queries are crafted to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. These queries include:
- Finding the count of movies each producer has produced that won an award.
- Listing the movies along with the count of nominations they received, arranged in descending order.
- Identifying producers who have produced movies that were both nominated and won an award.
- Determining the categories in which Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. won the award.
- Retrieving the count of winners for each category from the Winners table.

## LinkedIn Post
A LinkedIn post is created to summarize the key insights derived from the SQL queries. It highlights notable findings from the Oscars 2024 dataset and encourages further discussion on data insights.
